Foreword
========

Read this before you get started with Cookiecutter React Django. This hopefully answers some
questions about the purpose and goals of the project, and when you
should or should not be using it.

Project Generation Options
-----------------------------

Upon creating your project, you will be asked to define certain variables. These are described in detail here.

*project_name*:

  Your project’s human-readable name, capitals and spaces allowed.

*project_slug*:

  Your project’s slug without dashes or spaces. Used to name your repo and in other places where a Python-importable version of your project name is needed.
